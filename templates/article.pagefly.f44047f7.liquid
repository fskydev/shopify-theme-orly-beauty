How much did this idea change from initial concept to launching your brand?</span></h4><p class="sc-lcujXC epPudT pf-b54c" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-kIeTtH cnxSGb pf-f151">My business started as a hobby, posting photos on Instagram that inspired me, either of style ideas or vintage items I had thrifted. Sometimes it was classic rock stars and style icons I looked up to. It was purely a creative outlet for inspiration. I eventually was laid off from my corporate job (a blessing in disguise) and started selling vintage clothing through my IG to make ends meet. I was also making jewelry in my friend's garage, because I was broke and didn't even have a place to live at that time. When I reached about 10K followers on IG, I realized I should focus on fashion as a full-time business, but I still didn't have my niche completely figured out-- I was kind of all over the place, selling jewelry, clothing, housewares, and whatever I liked really, but I wasn't getting far with it, and I was still broke at the end of working 14-hour days. I finally took a major leap and decided to produce my own ideas, and ventured into fashion design. I didn't have the money to fund a production from a legit cut/sew agency, but I found one that liked my designs enough to take a chance on making samples for me. With those samples I ran a presale that pulled in well over enough to fund a production, and more importantly, I realized for the first time that people actually dig my ideas! So the business has just grown from there and I've continued putting my designs out into the world. The business today is way different (and way more successful) than how it started. I never thought I'd be a self-taught fashion designer and brand owner, and I still am not sure if I have the “right” idea, but I know I have a lot of happy customers out there, and many many more ideas to keep this brand growing.</span></p><h4 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-lmoMRL giuwNB pf-5e75"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-kIeTtH cnxSGb pf-ff97">How do you handle adversity and doubt?

I had nothing, and sometimes felt like I had little support as well. I had a boyfriend at the time who asked when I was going to get a “real job” and I had some family members suggest vocational fields I should consider for more promising and stable job opportunities. At times, I got very discouraged and would start applying for jobs or thinking of other business ideas. I experienced a LOT of adversity, doubt, and self-doubt, and I am not actually sure that I “handled it'' because, man, it took a toll on me and won at times! But I battled that by staying busy. I kept WORKING -- everyday, all day -- doing what I was interested in and passionate about. I didn't really know what else to do; it's the only thing that made me feel good during that hard time. Money was never the goal, and honestly, I am not sure what WAS the goal, but I know that hard work and passion DID eventually turn to success.</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/0185/5843/t/13/assets/pf-18147285--WHMClaire-Harlin.jpg?v=1582849079" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/0185/5843/t/13/assets/pf-18147285--WHMClaire-Harlin.jpg?v=1582849079 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/0185/5843/t/13/assets/pf-18147285--WHMClaire-Harlin_500x.jpg?v=1582849079 320w" sizes="(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, (min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1535px) 1280px, (min-width: 640px) and (max-width: 1023px) 768px, 320px" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-bYEvPH khGBIg pf-2c27"/><h4 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-lmoMRL giuwNB pf-6413"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-kIeTtH cnxSGb pf-a4e4">What has been your biggest set-back or road block and how did you handle that situation?</span></h4><p class="sc-lcujXC epPudT pf-3eae" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-kIeTtH cnxSGb pf-7072">My biggest roadblock has simply been the challenge of learning the business side of running a business. I experienced nearly overnight growth with my first major design, and I was not prepared. It took years of playing catch-up when it came to taxes, book-keeping, payroll, licensing, accounting, etc. And this was while continuing to grow, trying to build a staff, and keeping daily operations running. I still to this day have not gotten it all figured out — We are still selling out and wait listing customers on every production, and I am still paying tax penalties almost monthly for not filing on time. BUT it's running more smoothly every day, and all could have been avoided with better organization and preparation for growth from the beginning. </span></p><h4 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-lmoMRL giuwNB pf-3615"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-kIeTtH cnxSGb pf-34b2">As a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?&nbsp;<br></span></h4><p class="sc-lcujXC epPudT pf-73bc" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-kIeTtH cnxSGb pf-4ebc">A TV news lady. And I actually went to school for journalism. While in school, I realized that I was more suited for print journalism rather than broadcast.

I think starting in the workforce as early as 16 and keeping jobs all the time is very useful in learning a great work ethic. I actually worked all through college and never took out a loan. I loved working. Life after college is hard enough without all the student loans, and I can't imagine having had the weight of all that debt on my shoulders from day one. Student debt is such a major problem. Even if college takes a couple more years than planned, it's worth it to take your time, work, and enjoy life without digging a financial hole in the ground.</span></p><h4 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-lmoMRL giuwNB pf-0bc7"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-kIeTtH cnxSGb pf-4aed">What was your dream job before building your brand?&nbsp;<br></span></h4><p class="sc-lcujXC epPudT pf-e9a4" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-kIeTtH cnxSGb pf-7cd9">Had you asked me in college, I would have said an investigative reporter for the New York Times, living in the big city.

I've always been obsessed. My dad played bass in a classic rock cover band when I was a kid, and my mom had drawers full of all this 70s hippie stuff she would pass down to me... still today many of my favorite pieces of clothing. Nothing has been more iconic, legendary, and influential as the classic rock era —musically and stylistically. Everything about it is and always will be inspiring.

<br>
<br>Also, do not fear motherhood as being a career setback. In my busiest, most creative, and most profitable year yet, I gave birth to my first child, who just turned one, and I am expecting my second in a couple months. I used to harbor a lot of fear that I would have to choose between business and family, but I must say that becoming a mother has only further inspired me and made me capable of SO much more. Sure, there are still many societal challenges for women in business, but motherhood is NOT a roadblock to success.&nbsp;<br></span></p></div></div><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-cTkwdZ fFvlhF pf-e670"><div data-product-id="4496761454691" data-default-variant="32185167642723" data-pf-type="ProductBox" class="sc-jXktwP hdiogm pf-2ff6">{% assign defaultProduct = product %}{% assign product = product_4496761454691 %}<!-- -->{% if product != null %}{% form "product", product, data-productid: product.id, class: "pf-product-form" %}<div class="sc-jgHCyG eZqcrI pf-6d5b pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-sm:6;--c-lg:6"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-cTkwdZ fFvlhF pf-d013"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/0185/5843/t/13/assets/pf-2915a9d9--02-Clarie-Harlin.jpg?v=1583254586" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/0185/5843/t/13/assets/pf-2915a9d9--02-Clarie-Harlin.jpg?v=1583254586 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, (min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1535px) 1280px, (min-width: 640px) and (max-width: 1023px) 768px, 320px" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-bYEvPH khGBIg pf-343f"/></div></div><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-sm:6;--c-lg:6"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-cTkwdZ fFvlhF pf-2b7a"><h3 data-product-type="title" data-product-id="{{ product.id }}" data-pf-type="ProductTitle" class="sc-gkdzZj cmAEMu pf-11f9">{{ product.title }}</h3><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-iJuUWI fTbwUB pf-5603"><div data-oke-reviews-product-listing-rating>
